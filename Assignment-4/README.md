# Assignment 4 - Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignment 4** of the Python course (Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Opens and reads a text file named **sample.txt**.
- Prints its content line by line with line numbers.
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to **output.txt**.
- Appends additional data to the same file.
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.

## Files
- **Task1.py** → Solution for Task 1 (Read and handle errors).
- **Task2.py** → Solution for Task 2 (Write, append, and display content).

✅ Both tasks include proper error handling and follow the assignment instructions.
